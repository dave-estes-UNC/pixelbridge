Blending
--------
When using one of the three blending techniques, a 50% black frame is rendered over the video frame.

Temporal Blending - Flips back and forth between black frame and video frame.

Frame Volume Blending - Moves a decoded video frame to a plane of the Frame Volume. Then it uses a frame volume copy command to copy (w/ blend) the 50% black frame over it.

Coefficient Plane Blending - Uses two coefficient planes and the result is blended 50/50.
