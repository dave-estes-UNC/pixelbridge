Overview

This bin directory contains all of the scripts use to run the various
experiments.

Scripts
=======

MMSYS2012
---------

This single script runs the experiments MMSYS2012,which include the
original modes (fb, flat, cached-8, cached-4, dct-1, dct-4, and dct100)
as well as the three original blending modes. Note that the dct modes were
not there fore MMSYS20212, but this script was adapted to run them to get
the results again from scratch with the dct tiled mode for ACMMM2015.

*   *runexperiments.sh*
    Takes three parameters to specify the path to the pixelbridge executable,
    the path to the recordings, directory and the path to the output directory.

ACMMM2015
---------

These scripts were used for ACMMM2015. runexperiments.sh was repurposed and
then runall.sh and runflow.sh were added to get the prediction-residual
experiment results.

*   *runexperiments.sh*
    This script was adapted from MMSYS2012 to re-run the original experiments
    and to add in the results for the dct tiled mode. Takes three parameters to
    specify the path to the pixelbridge executable, the path to the recordings,
     directory and the path to the output directory.
*   *runall.sh*
    Runs all of the low/medium/high segments using
    the low/medium/high compression budgets for the
    ACMMM2015 prediction-residual experiments.
*   *runbourne.sh*
    Runs only the bourne low/medium/high segments using
    the low/medium/high compression budgets for the
    ACMMM2015 prediction-residual experiments
*   *runauto.sh*
    This script is the workhorse for the ACMMM2015
    prediction-residual experiments which used a budget to
    determine how much to "compress" the video.
*   *runflow.sh*
    Runs the optical flow calculation and analysis for
    the ACMMM2015 prediction-residual experiments.

*   *runscales.sh*
    Runs through several different multiscale configurations to
    determine the most effective ones using just the bourne-10-action
    video. This script doesn't produce results for the paper, but
    was used when trying to find the candidate configurations for
    the experiments run from runall.sh.
