TODO
x Create new nDDI APIs to update the scaler for each coefficient matrix.
x Correctly initialize the coefficient planes with 0 scalers (PixelBridgeMain, FlatTiler, and CachedTiler).
x Update GlNddiDisplay rendering to use multiple coefficient planes.
x Update coefficent blending mode to actually use the new and official multiple coefficient support.
x Implement DctTiler.
  x Initialize Frame Volume with pre-rendered basis functions
  x Initialize Coefficient Planes
  x Debug: Make a dummy tile updater that just renders 64 macroblocks as the basis functions themselves.
  x Implement proper updater
  x Figure out the proper sign-extending and clamping strategy for the accumulators in ComputePixel().
  x Implement a FillScalerTiled that will accept an array of scalers and fill each tile in the plane with the provided scaler
x Review and fix ALL transmission cost calculations. Pay attention to the p in the (x, y, p) locations for coefficient planes.
x Get PSNR working again.
x Add cost model tracking for scaler writes...and read?
x For DCT, initializing the coefficient plane is KILLING me. Fix it by:
  x Redesign it to fill the a coefficient matrix to an 8x8x192 area.
  x Then kill in the k values for each of the 192 planes.
- Update the coefficient plane to update the cost model correctly and efficiently with OpenMP.
- Determine if it's necessary to narrow some data values like scalers and coordinates (for transmission).
- Re-run all of the original experiments including the new video-based tilers.
- Revisit the Blending Experiments
  - Get Temporal Blending working
  - Get FrameVolume Blending working again
  - Devise some experiments for blending, perhaps a HUD on top of video.
- Implement FillScaler API for ClNddiDisplay.
- Implement FillScalerTiles API for ClNddiDisplay.
- Implement FillScalerTileStack API for ClNddiDisplay.
- Update ClNddiDisplay to use multiple coefficient planes.


Future Work
- Add nDDI command caching and playback mode. Will avoid the video decode and tiler calculations.
- Modify FFMPEG's MJPEG decoder to and have it create DCT coefficients for the DctTiler automatically.
