TODO
x Create new nDDI APIs to update the scaler for each coefficient matrix.
x Correctly initialize the coefficient planes with 0 scalers (PixelBridgeMain, FlatTiler, and CachedTiler).
x Update GlNddiDisplay rendering to use multiple coefficient planes.
x Update coefficent blending mode to actually use the new and official multiple coefficient support.
- Implement DctTiler.
  x Initialize Frame Volume with pre-rendered basis functions
  x Initialize Coefficient Planes
  x Debug: Make a dummy tile updater that just renders 64 macroblocks as the basis functions themselves.
  - Implement proper updater
  - Optimize updater so that it doesn't have to fill with zeroes first.
  - Implement a FillScalerTiled that will accept an array of scalers and fill each tile in the plane with the provided scaler

- Use a copy constructor or something similar to speed up the initialization of the coefficient planes.

- Review and fix ALL transmission cost calculations. Pay attention to the p in the (x, y, p) locations for coefficient planes.

- Implement FillScalerTiles API for BaseNddiDisplay.

- Implement FillScaler API for ClNddiDisplay.
- Implement FillScalerTiles API for ClNddiDisplay.
- Update ClNddiDisplay to use multiple coefficient planes.


Future Work
- Add nDDI command caching and playback mode. Will avoid the video decode and tiler calculations.
- Modify FFMPEG's MJPEG decoder to and have it create DCT coefficients for the DctTiler automatically.
