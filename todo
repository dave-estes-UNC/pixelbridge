Must Do
- Get ClNddiDisplay working.
  - Create ClInputVector, ClCoefficientPlane, and ClFrameVolume
    - Update Coefficient Plane on-demand, removing the temporary hack for SIMPLE and FIXED modes
    - Update Input Vector on-demand
    - Update Frame Volume on-demand, removing temporary hack for SIMPLE
  - Stop using floats when creating the Framebuffer image and in the computePixel() kernel
  - Consider setting up coefficient plane as a 3D buffer with the Coefficients arranged along the third dimension. This might help get them down to individual workgroup memory better.
- Add back PSNR calculation. Should likely be done in the CachedTiler.

Performance Improvements
- For CachedTiler::UpdateDisplay(), figure out how to parallelize the outter loop so that the crcs are checked in
  parallel like with the FlatTiler. This might involve pipelining some of the steps in there, but hopefully not all.
- Parallelize tiling and rendering:
  - Create NddiLink class that spawns its own thread and listens for NDDI commands.
  - PixelBridge will then use an NddiLinkProxy to send those commands.
  - That proxy is itself an implementation of the NDDI API.
  - NddiLink will buffer incoming commands and handle them one at a time.
  - If the buffer fills, then the NddiLinkProxy API blocks until the buffer frees up.
  - Should use signals here to avoid polling.


Nice-To-Have
- Clean up blending support, but creating MultiCoefficientPlane and BlendingFrameVolume that each extend their corresponding base classes.


Future Work
- Add fixed point math support
